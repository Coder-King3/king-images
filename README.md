| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Original image                               | baseURL/1.jpg                      |
| Original resolution, quality compression     | baseURL/1.jpg@1e_1c.jpg            |
| Specified width, adaptive height, compressed | baseURL/1.jpg@104w_1e_1c.jpg       |
| Specified height, adaptive width, compressed | baseURL/1.jpg@104h_1e_1c.jpg       |
| Specified dimensions, compressed             | baseURL/1.jpg@104w_104h_1e_1c.jpg  |
| Original resolution, webp format (smallest)  | baseURL/1.jpg@104w_104h_1e_1c.webp |
| Specified height, webp format (smallest)     | baseURL/1.jpg@104w_104h_1e_1c.webp |

Format: (original image URL)@(\d+[whsepqoc]\_?)\*(\.(|webp|gif|png|jpg|jpeg))?$

- w:[1, 9223372036854775807] (width, image width)
- h:[1, 9223372036854775807] (height, image height)
- s:[1, 9223372036854775807] (unknown function)
- e:[0,2] (resize, 0:maintain ratio take smaller, 1:maintain ratio take larger, 2:don't maintain original ratio, don't mix with c)
- p:[1,1000] (default 100, magnification, don't mix with c)
- q:[1,100] (quality, default 75, image quality)
- o:[0,1] (unknown function)
- c:[0,1] (clip, 0:default, 1:crop)
- webp,png,jpeg,gif (keeps original format if not specified)
- Case insensitive, same parameters later override earlier ones
- The actual w*h after calculation cannot be greater than the original w*h, otherwise the wh parameter is ineffective

### Hotlinking Prevention Solutions

#### Site-wide Image Usage

Add the following tag in the HTML head, so all resource references won't carry the referrer

```html
<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer" />
```

#### Opening in New Window

Set rel="noreferrer". Note that using window.open will carry the referrer by default, and the first access might still return a 403 error

```html
<a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"></a>
```
